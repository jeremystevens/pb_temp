🧩 Modularization Plan for Legacy PHP Paste App

🎯 Objective:
Refactor the existing monolithic PHP codebase to a modular architecture. This will increase maintainability, scalability, and reusability, making the app easier to expand, debug, and test.

---

✅ Why Modularization?
- Improves code readability and structure.
- Allows reusing components across different parts of the app.
- Isolates functionality to minimize side effects and regression bugs.
- Enables more efficient teamwork and version control.

🔧 What We're Trying to Accomplish:

1. **Separate Logic from Presentation**
   - Extract inline PHP logic from views and templates.
   - Move database queries, validation, and data processing into dedicated PHP classes or modules.

2. **Introduce Reusable Components**
   - Turn common UI elements (headers, footers, paste metadata, tag display) into reusable partials or includes.
   - Turn tag logic and paste formatting into reusable functions or helper classes.

3. **Improve Routing & File Structure**
   - Split responsibilities into `controllers/`, `models/`, and `views/` folders.
   - Establish a router or front controller pattern to handle requests.

4. **Make Tag & Metadata Rendering Modular**
   - Extract the tag rendering logic (recently added) into its own PHP partial or helper function.
   - Ensure metadata (author, views, language, tags) can be reused in multiple templates.

5. **Prepare for Mobile-Responsive Enhancements**
   - Refactor container and layout CSS into modular, scalable classes.
   - Ensure responsiveness logic is not embedded directly in pages but managed through global styles.

6. **Ensure Backward Compatibility**
   - Carefully migrate and test each component without disrupting existing features.
   - Apply changes incrementally, verifying paste view functionality and tag display as we go.

📁 Example Structure Post-Modularization:

- index.php
- /controllers
  - PasteController.php
- /models
  - Paste.php
  - Tag.php
- /views
  - paste_view.php
  - layout.php
  - partials/
    - header.php
    - footer.php
    - paste_meta.php
    - tag_list.php
- /assets
  - style.css
- /helpers
  - Formatter.php
  - TagHelper.php

🛠 Outcome:
A modernized PHP pastebin-style app that’s easier to manage, modify, and expand — ready for features like search, authentication, or an admin panel.
