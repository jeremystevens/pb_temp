SUBJECT: Load Template Modal No Longer Loads – Likely Due to Event Unbinding or Premature JS Conditions

Overview:
---------
The fix for preventing duplicate modals unintentionally broke the modal loading behavior entirely. Now, when clicking the "Load Template" button, **nothing happens** — no modal appears.

Based on your last changes, this likely stems from one or more of the following:
1. The check for existing modals (`if (!document.getElementById(...))`) is blocking all modal creation.
2. The `createTemplateModal()` function is never called because the binding to the "Load Template" button has been removed or delayed.
3. The modal is being created but not appended to the document, or the DOM isn’t ready when it's executed.

Fix Instructions:
-----------------
1. Re-review the logic in `paste-form.js`, especially `window.loadTemplate` and `createTemplateModal()`:
   - Ensure the check for duplicate modal IDs is **correct and not overly strict**.
   - Make sure that if no modal exists, `createTemplateModal()` is still called and the modal is appended to the DOM.

2. Confirm this logic:
```javascript
if (!document.getElementById("template-modal")) {
  createTemplateModal();  // Ensure this is still running when needed
}
```

3. Verify the "Load Template" button binding:
   - Ensure the button has the correct `id` or `onclick` reference (`loadTemplate()` or `window.loadTemplate()`).
   - Make sure `window.loadTemplate` is assigned only once and not accidentally cleared.

4. Check for console errors:
   - There may be silent JS errors due to missing elements or bad function calls that are halting script execution.

Validation:
-----------
- Click "Load Template"
- Modal should appear only once
- Modal contents are complete, interactive, and positioned correctly

Conclusion:
-----------
In preventing duplication, modal creation logic may have been blocked entirely. Please audit the modal existence checks and rebind the event listener to ensure correct behavior is restored.
