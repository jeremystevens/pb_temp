Overview:
---------
The current `index.php` file is over 8,000 lines long, which makes it extremely difficult to maintain, debug, or modify effectively. To move toward a scalable, mobile-first design and simplify future updates, we need to modularize the file without altering or breaking its logic.

The following instructions should be followed with precision and caution to ensure no code is lost, no features are broken, and all PHP logic continues to function properly after restructuring.

Primary Goal:
-------------
Break `index.php` into the following smaller include files:

1. includes/header.php
   - Contains:
     - The opening HTML tags
     - <head> section with meta, title, link, and script tags
     - The opening <body> tag
     - Site branding or top nav if applicable

2. includes/sidebar.php
   - Contains:
     - Sidebar UI or floating buttons
     - Navigation links (if any)
     - Mobile toggle controls (if any)

3. includes/main-content.php
   - Contains:
     - The full central layout and form functionality
     - Any container, form, card, or text content between header and footer

4. includes/footer.php
   - Contains:
     - Footer HTML
     - Closing </body> and </html> tags
     - Any final scripts or inline JavaScript
     - Optional copyright

Steps to Modularize:
--------------------
1. Create a new folder: `/includes`
2. Open `index.php` and scan for major structural sections: <head>, <body>, form, footer, scripts.
3. Cut and paste each section into the corresponding file as described above.
4. Replace each cut section in `index.php` with a PHP include:

   Example:
   <?php include 'includes/header.php'; ?>
   <?php include 'includes/sidebar.php'; ?>
   <?php include 'includes/main-content.php'; ?>
   <?php include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>

5. Do NOT move PHP logic or backend handlers (e.g., session, DB config) outside of `index.php` unless clearly part of the view/layout layer.

6. After saving all changes, preview the app to confirm:
   - No errors
   - Page content renders correctly
   - JavaScript and CSS still load
   - Forms and buttons still work as expected

Backup Warning:
---------------
Before making changes:
- Create a backup copy of the current `index.php` file and name it `index-backup.php`.

Summary:
---------
This modularization is critical to enable responsive fixes, performance tuning, and developer maintainability. Each include file must be carefully scoped and tested to avoid loss of functionality. Please complete these edits and test the result before moving on to responsive layout changes.
