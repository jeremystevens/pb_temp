SUBJECT: Fix SQL Datatype Mismatch in index.php â€“ Ensure Boolean Fields Are Properly Cast

Overview:
---------
The current version of `index.php` is failing with a fatal error:

  SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 20 datatype mismatch

This occurs during execution of the SQL `INSERT INTO pastes (...)` query, specifically on the line:

  $stmt->execute([$uniqueid, $title, $encryptedContent, $syntax, $expire_time, $password, $burn_after_read, $zero_knowledge, $created_at]);

Root Cause:
-----------
The variables `$burn_after_read` and `$zero_knowledge` are either undefined or are not explicitly cast to integers before being passed to the SQL statement.

SQLite requires strict typing. These fields must be passed as integers (0 or 1), not booleans (`true`/`false`), strings (`"true"`/`"false"`), or nulls.

Required Fix:
-------------
Before the `$stmt->execute(...)` call, add:

```php
$burn_after_read = !empty($_POST['burn_after_read']) ? 1 : 0;
$zero_knowledge = !empty($_POST['zero_knowledge']) ? 1 : 0;
```

This guarantees that these values are passed as valid integers (`0` or `1`) into the database.

Validation:
-----------
- After the fix, the SQL `INSERT` should succeed without datatype mismatch errors.
- Paste creation should work for all types: standard, burn-after-read, and zero-knowledge.

Conclusion:
-----------
Please apply this simple but critical fix to restore paste submission functionality and resolve the PDOException.
