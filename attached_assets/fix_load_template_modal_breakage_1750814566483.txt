SUBJECT: Load Template Modal Not Showing After JS Edits – Please Restore Modal Trigger

Overview:
---------
Thank you for restoring the Advanced Options toggle. That’s working correctly now.

However, the recent changes to `paste-form.js` appear to have broken the Load Template functionality. The modal no longer opens when clicking the "Load Template" button, which previously worked.

Issue:
------
- Clicking the "Load Template" button no longer opens the modal.
- This was working before the recent JS and PHP fixes.
- The modal markup still exists, so the issue is likely with the event listener or export/import.

Required Fix:
-------------
1. Re-check the `paste-form.js` file:
   - Ensure it contains the `loadTemplateModal()` or equivalent function that triggers modal visibility.
   - Ensure this function is bound to the button's `onclick` event correctly.

2. Reconnect the modal open handler:
   - The "Load Template" button should call `loadTemplateModal()` or dispatch a modal open event on click.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("load-template-btn").addEventListener("click", loadTemplateModal);
     ```

3. Confirm that the modal is still in the DOM and is hidden via class or style (not removed entirely).

4. Make sure the modal JS is loaded **after** the DOM is ready.
   - Wrap in `DOMContentLoaded` or ensure it's loaded at the end of the body.

Validation:
-----------
- Click "Load Template" → modal should appear.
- Modal buttons should remain functional (language selection, load, close).
- Confirm modal logic is not conflicting with `paste-form.js` refactors.

Conclusion:
-----------
The Load Template modal broke after resolving unrelated issues. Please restore its event binding and visibility behavior so users can select a language again.
