SUBJECT: Restore Full Paste View Page with All Original Functionality (from index-backup.php)

Overview:
---------
The current modularized paste view page (view-paste.php) is missing the full design and features that were present in the original layout (from index-backup.php).

⚠️ It is CRITICAL that the paste view page is restored EXACTLY as it was in the original site, with ALL functionality working as it originally did — both frontend and backend.

--------------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
--------------------------------------------------------

1. MIGRATE LOGIC FROM index-backup.php
- Restore all PHP logic used to retrieve and display:
  - Paste metadata (title, author, date, views)
  - Content (with syntax highlighting)
  - Statistics: views, likes, characters, lines, size, etc.
  - Zero-knowledge handling
  - Burn-after-read logic
  - Password protection check
  - Forking, chaining, versioning data

2. UPDATE includes/view-paste.php
- Move the complete paste rendering logic into this file
- Use $_GET['view'] or clean URLs to resolve paste_id
- Display the correct paste record and content using new routing logic

3. ENSURE TEMPLATE INCLUDES ALL UI SECTIONS
- Restore navigation tabs: Overview, Comments, Discussions
- Add supporting tab content containers (even if placeholders)
- AI summary section placeholder (if not functional yet)
- Tags or related pastes logic if it existed in original

4. RESTORE ALL FUNCTIONAL BUTTONS
- Copy to Clipboard
- View Raw
- Download
- Clone
- Fork
- Report
- Print

5. HANDLE EXPIRATION AND TIME FORMATTING
- Countdown timer should display real-time expiry (in JS)
- Time since creation should read as "just now", "5 mins ago", "3 days ago", "1 year ago", etc.

6. ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH:
- New paste_id (custom string IDs)
- SQLite schema (check field names)
- Modular includes (header/footer/sidebar)

7. VALIDATE ON FRONTEND
- Test normal, expired, passworded, and zero-knowledge pastes
- Confirm layout is fully restored visually and functionally

--------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion:
--------------------------------------------------------
This paste view page is one of the most important features of the platform and must be restored to FULL parity with the original version (as shown in index-backup.php and screenshot references). All visual components, interactive buttons, and backend logic must be included.

Please prioritize fidelity and completeness.
