SUBJECT: UI Layout Regression â€“ Header Controls Render Outside Container

Overview:
---------
There is a visual bug in the paste creation form: the top action buttons (`+ Create New Paste`, `Load Template`, `Import`) are rendering outside the container or header bar where they belong. This is clearly visible when comparing the two attached screenshots.

Expected Behavior:
------------------
- All top controls should be aligned inside a container or flex parent that centers or right-aligns them within the layout bounds.
- These controls should follow consistent spacing and padding as seen in the original version.

Issue:
------
- The current layout likely renders these buttons outside the intended wrapper `<div>`, or without `container`, `layout-between`, or `section-header` class bindings.
- This may have occurred during modularization or restructuring of `header.php`.

Fix Instructions:
-----------------
1. Open `includes/header.php` or wherever the top nav/buttons are defined.
2. Wrap the control buttons (`Create New Paste`, `Load Template`, `Import`) inside a div with proper container and alignment classes.

   Required Structure:
   - Use a class like:
     <div class="container layout-between items-center section-header">
   - Inside that div, position the controls to float-right or justify-end if using flex.
   - Ensure consistent padding and spacing using layout or spacing utility classes (e.g. `px-4`, `gap-4`, etc.)

3. Verify the header is not:
   - Positioned absolutely or outside the page flow
   - Floating above the form or leaking into unrelated layout sections

4. Ensure this container is within the responsive grid or main layout wrapper so it scales properly.

Validation:
-----------
- After fixing the header layout, test at multiple screen widths (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- All three buttons should remain inside the top section, correctly aligned and responsive.

Conclusion:
-----------
This misalignment makes the UI look broken and unstructured. Please re-wrap the control buttons inside their proper layout container to restore the original header format as shown in the second screenshot.
