Overview:
---------
Following the recent modularization update, the "Create Paste" UI is now broken and incomplete. The key issue is that the top section (including the "+ Create New Paste", "Load Template", and "Import" buttons) is completely missing. In addition, core logic such as Zero-Knowledge encryption, submit behavior, and form grouping have been partially or fully removed.

This breaks critical functionality and user experience that was working in the original version.

Key Issues to Address:
-----------------------
1. **Header Action Buttons Missing**
   - "+ Create New Paste"
   - "Load Template"
   - "Import"
   These should appear above the Title input field, aligned right, inside a flex container.

2. **Zero-Knowledge Encryption Behavior Missing**
   - The encryption script should trigger on blur/focus-out of the content input area.
   - It should encrypt text using the client-side JavaScript logic and insert the encryption key into the generated link or metadata.

3. **Submit Button Does Not Create Paste**
   - The submit logic that handles content creation on form submission appears to be broken or disconnected.
   - Ensure the full JavaScript and server-side logic that receives and stores the paste is still intact.

4. **Advanced Options and Fieldsets Misaligned**
   - Language, expiration, visibility, tags, and password fields must be restored and styled using the original layout (flex rows, stacked spacing).

Fix Instructions:
-----------------
1. Open `includes/main-content.php` or the file containing the paste creation form.
2. Restore the full structure of the form section from the original `index.php` before modularization. Reference the second screenshot for layout and behavior.

3. Specifically:
   - Insert the top buttons inside a flex wrapper, e.g.:
     <div class="container layout-between items-center section-header">
       <a href="/" class="btn btn-primary">+ Create New Paste</a>
       <div class="layout-inline gap-2">
         <button class="btn btn-outline" onclick="loadTemplate()">Load Template</button>
         <button class="btn btn-outline" onclick="importFromFile()">Import</button>
       </div>
     </div>

4. Reconnect the original JS functionality:
   - Zero-Knowledge encryption must still run via the original `paste.encrypt.js` or equivalent.
   - Ensure the `onsubmit` handler still routes the form content to the appropriate PHP handling endpoint.

5. Verify styling and structure:
   - Form inputs should be grouped with `.layout-stack` and `.form-field` wrappers.
   - Restore the original order and block layout:
     Title > ZK Checkbox > Content Box > Advanced Options > Visibility > Password > Submit Button

6. Confirm JavaScript imports are still included in the footer (`footer.php` or at bottom of `index.php`).
   - Required scripts: ZK encryption logic, content handlers, language selectors, etc.

Validation:
-----------
- Confirm the UI exactly matches the second screenshot layout.
- Verify encryption fires correctly on blur and that the encryption key is handled.
- Ensure a successful paste is created when the "Create Paste" button is clicked.
- Test visibility toggles, expiration dropdown, and password protection.

Conclusion:
-----------
This is a major regression that breaks critical functionality. All original "Create Paste" features must be fully restored from the original version before modularization. That includes layout, JS behavior, encryption, and submission.
