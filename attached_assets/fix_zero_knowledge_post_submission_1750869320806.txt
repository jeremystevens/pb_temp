SUBJECT: Correct the Post-Submission Flow for Zero-Knowledge Pastes (Client-Side Encryption)

Overview:
---------
The Zero-Knowledge paste creation form works correctly on the new modularized layout ‚Äî the encryption checkbox is present and the content is encrypted before being sent to the server.

However, the **post-submission flow** is currently incorrect. This functionality must exactly replicate the original behavior.

It is critical that **Steps 3 to 5 below are restored properly**, exactly as in the previous implementation.

---------------------------------------
REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
---------------------------------------

‚úÖ Step 3: Submission Process (in Browser)
-----------------------------------------
- When the user clicks ‚ÄúCreate Paste‚Äù with Zero-Knowledge enabled:
  - A visual loading indicator should appear: ‚ÄúEncrypting content‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - Encryption must be performed entirely client-side (as currently handled by existing JS logic)
  - The encrypted payload should be submitted via standard POST to `index.php`
  - NO encryption key should be sent to the server ‚Äî only encrypted text

‚úÖ Step 4: Success Response + URL Generation
-------------------------------------------
- After the paste is saved server-side:
  - Server should return ONLY the paste ID (not the key)
  - The frontend JS should combine:
    - Paste ID (e.g. `abc123`)
    - Encryption Key from client
  - And build a full view URL like:
    `https://domain.com/abc123#zk=<encryption-key>`

- Display a success message that reads:
  ‚Äú‚úÖ Zero-Knowledge paste created! Save this URL ‚Äì it contains your decryption key.‚Äù

- Also display:
  ‚Äúüîê This URL is required to view the paste. We cannot recover it if lost.‚Äù

- Add a "Copy URL" button that copies the full link to clipboard

‚úÖ Step 5: Immediate Paste View + Decryption
-------------------------------------------
- Redirect the user to the view page (e.g. `/abc123#zk=<key>`)
- Ensure the `paste-form.js` (or similar) handles client-side decryption upon page load:
  - Grab the hash key from the `location.hash`
  - Decrypt the paste content
  - Replace the placeholder with decrypted text
- Visual cues should include:
  - "Encrypted Paste" badge or icon
  - Tooltip or message explaining this is a Zero-Knowledge paste

üîê Notes:
---------
- This behavior is **mission-critical** to privacy promises of the platform.
- The encryption key MUST NEVER be logged, stored, or sent to the server.
- This logic was fully functional in the original `index-backup.php` and associated JS files.

-------------------------------
Please ensure ALL of these behaviors are restored EXACTLY as before, with matching UI messages and encryption logic.
