SUBJECT: Fix Post-Creation Redirect and Sidebar Paste View Navigation

Overview:
---------
We have multiple broken behaviors after submitting a paste and navigating from the sidebar:

1. ❌ User is NOT redirected after clicking "Create Paste"
2. ❌ Generated URL is still: /abc123?id=abc123
3. ❌ Clicking a paste from the sidebar does not open the paste view — it remains stuck on the create form

These issues need to be addressed together.

------------------------------------------------------------
✅ FIX #1 — Redirect After Paste Creation Must Work
------------------------------------------------------------
In `index.php` (or wherever the form POST is handled), after the paste is successfully created:

1. Ensure this redirect line exists:
```php
header("Location: /{$paste_id}");
exit;
```

2. The `exit;` is CRITICAL — without it, PHP will continue and render the wrong content.

------------------------------------------------------------
✅ FIX #2 — Remove Redundant Query String From Paste URLs
------------------------------------------------------------
Anywhere links to pastes are generated (e.g., sidebar, archive):

Current:
```php
<a href="/<?= $paste_id ?>?id=<?= $paste_id ?>">
```

Fix:
```php
<a href="/<?= $paste_id ?>">
```

This includes:
- Sidebar pastes
- Archive/index listings
- Post-submission success message

------------------------------------------------------------
✅ FIX #3 — Make Sure View Mode Triggers Correctly on Paste Load
------------------------------------------------------------
The router in `index.php` must correctly detect when a paste is being viewed.

Example logic:
```php
if (isset($_GET['view'])) {
  // This is a view paste request
  include 'includes/view-paste.php';
  exit;
}
```

Also ensure that the `.htaccess` is working and rewriting `/abc123` to:
```
index.php?view=abc123
```

------------------------------------------------------------
Once these are fixed:
- Submitting a paste should redirect to the correct clean URL
- Sidebar clicks should load the paste viewer
- No more `?id=` in any URLs
