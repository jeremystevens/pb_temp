SUBJECT: Restore Paste Viewing Page (Using Custom paste_id)

Overview:
---------
In the new implementation, users can create pastes with custom `paste_id` values (e.g., `kjAzhSUG`) rather than referencing the internal database `id`. We now need to restore the paste view functionality â€” the page users land on when they click a paste in the sidebar or from the archive.

This should faithfully replicate the look and behavior of the original `index-backup.php`, but using the new paste_id routing system.

Required Fixes:
---------------

1. **Create New Paste View Page**
   - Create a file like `view.php` or add a case to `index.php` for `?view=<paste_id>`
   - Extract and reuse the paste display layout and markup from `index-backup.php`

2. **Route by paste_id Instead of id**
   - Update SQL query to:
     ```php
     $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM pastes WHERE paste_id = ?");
     $stmt->execute([$paste_id]);
     $paste = $stmt->fetch();
     ```

3. **Fallback for Not Found**
   - If `$paste` is `false`, show a "Paste Not Found" message

4. **Apply Legacy Display Features**
   - Paste title
   - Paste content with code styling (e.g., `<pre><code>`)
   - Language label
   - Expiration info (countdown)
   - Zero-knowledge message if applicable
   - Burn-after-read logic (delete after view if enabled)

5. **Add Routing Support**
   - In `index.php`, check for:
     ```php
     if (isset($_GET['view'])) {
         include 'includes/view-paste.php';
         exit;
     }
     ```

6. **Update Sidebar / Archive Paste Links**
   - Ensure all paste links now point to:
     ```html
     <a href="?view=<paste_id>">View</a>
     ```

7. **Track View Uniqueness (Optional)**
   - Only increment views when a valid paste is viewed by a unique IP (as previously outlined)

Conclusion:
-----------
This ensures pastes are viewable again using the new short ID system while restoring all the original UX and formatting. Please retain the behavior and styles from `index-backup.php` while updating the logic to work with the modular layout and custom IDs.
