Overview:
---------
You've successfully extracted the main layout structure into modular components:
- includes/header.php
- includes/sidebar.php
- includes/main-content.php
- includes/footer.php

However, `index.php` has not yet been updated to actually use these includes. The diff shows +0 / -0, meaning no edits were made. This step is essential to complete the modularization process.

Instructions:
-------------
Please update `index.php` to use the new modular structure by replacing the full-page HTML structure with the following includes:

<?php include 'includes/header.php'; ?>
<?php include 'includes/sidebar.php'; ?>
<?php include 'includes/main-content.php'; ?>
<?php include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>

This will ensure `index.php` simply acts as the layout orchestrator and loads the content from the correct modular files.

Caution:
--------
- Do not remove any PHP logic related to session control, configuration, or backend handlers that must stay in `index.php`.
- If unsure, keep those above the `include` calls.

Verification:
-------------
After saving:
- Load the page and confirm it renders without PHP errors.
- Ensure CSS and JS are loading.
- Confirm that all modular pieces display in the correct order (header, sidebar, content, footer).

Backup:
-------
Before applying the includes, save the current `index.php` as `index-backup.php` to preserve the original for safety.

Conclusion:
-----------
This final step connects the modularized files into your application. Once done, you’ll have a clean structure that’s easier to maintain, style, and debug.
