SUBJECT: URGENT â€“ Missing paste_id Column Causes SQL Error

Overview:
---------
A fatal SQL error is occurring when attempting to create a new paste:

  SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 no such column: paste_id
  File: index.php, Line: 25

This confirms the table `pastes` does not yet include the column `paste_id`, which is being referenced in a SELECT query and an INSERT statement.

Required Fix:
-------------
Run the following SQL command immediately in the SQLite environment:

```sql
ALTER TABLE pastes ADD COLUMN paste_id TEXT UNIQUE;
```

Optional but Recommended:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_paste_id ON pastes(paste_id);
```

Why This Is Required:
---------------------
The new version of the codebase is using `paste_id` as a short, shareable public identifier for each paste. This replaces reliance on the internal `id` field for public-facing routing and identification.

Conclusion:
-----------
This single schema change will resolve the current error and enable the paste creation functionality to work as intended using the new system.
