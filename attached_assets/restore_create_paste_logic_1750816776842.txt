SUBJECT: Restore Full Paste Creation Logic from Original index.php (Now index-backup.php)

Overview:
---------
Currently, clicking the "Create Paste" button at the bottom of the form does nothing. This is because **all of the original paste creation logic** — including handling advanced features like zero-knowledge encryption and burn-after-read — was previously embedded in the monolithic `index.php` file.

That file has now been renamed to `index-backup.php`, but the business logic inside it has **not been reconnected** to the modularized layout.

This is a critical issue.

Importance:
-----------
The paste creation system was not just a simple POST handler — it included:
- Support for multiple paste types (e.g. public, unlisted, password-protected)
- Burn-after-read functionality
- Zero-knowledge encryption (ZK paste via blur/focus encryption on the client side)
- Handling of expiration, visibility, syntax highlighting, language selection
- Secure generation of unique paste IDs
- Server-side sanitation and validation
- Error handling and redirection

Instructions:
-------------

1. **Review the entire paste handling logic in `index-backup.php`**
   - Locate all logic tied to handling form submission (`$_POST`), especially blocks like:
     ```php
     if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') { ... }
     ```
   - Identify how zero-knowledge encryption is handled (via JS + Base64).
   - Check how passwords, expiration time, syntax highlighting, and visibility flags are passed and processed.

2. **Extract the full paste creation logic into a separate handler**
   - For maintainability, extract it to a file like `create-paste.php` or `submit-paste.php`.
   - Route form submissions to that file using `action="create-paste.php"` in the form tag.
   - Include all the conditional logic to support:
     - Plain vs. ZK vs. Burn-after-read pastes
     - Input validation
     - Proper redirect to `/view/{pasteid}` after successful creation

3. **Ensure compatibility with the new layout**
   - Match all field names (`name="..."`) between the new form and the original logic.
   - Ensure JS triggers and encryption logic are properly loaded (e.g., `paste.js`, `encrypt.js` if applicable).
   - Maintain existing redirect behavior, success messages, and failure handling.

4. **Re-test full submission flow**
   - Create a plain paste
   - Create a zero-knowledge paste (blur → encrypt → submit → view decrypted)
   - Create a burn-after-read paste (submit → open once → verify deletion)
   - Test password-protected and tag-assigned pastes

Conclusion:
-----------
The Create Paste button must be wired back to all the intelligent logic that previously existed in `index.php`. Without this, the new UI is functionally broken. Please prioritize reconnecting all this logic to restore core application functionality.
