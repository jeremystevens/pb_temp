SUBJECT: Verify SQLite Schema for Table 'pastes' to Identify Datatype Mismatch

Overview:
---------
All 11 values passed to the SQL `INSERT INTO pastes (...)` statement have been validated via var_dump. Each field matches its expected data type (strings, integers, or NULLs).

Despite this, a SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 20 datatype mismatch is still being thrown on line 129 of index.php.

This indicates the issue now lies in the schema constraints of the `pastes` table â€” particularly potential NOT NULL or FOREIGN KEY constraints.

Instructions:

1. **Run the Following SQL Command in SQLite Console:**
```sql
.schema pastes
```

This will output the full CREATE TABLE definition used by the `pastes` table.

2. **Inspect the Following:**

- Confirm that `user_id` is allowed to be NULL:
  - It should be defined as: `user_id TEXT` or `user_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL`
  - If it is defined as `user_id TEXT NOT NULL` or has a FOREIGN KEY constraint, the NULL value currently passed will cause the error.

- Check if `paste_id` is PRIMARY KEY or has a UNIQUE constraint:
  - If a duplicate ID is generated by accident, this can silently trigger this SQL error.

- Validate that each field in the schema matches the type of value passed:
  - `expire_time` and `created_at` must be INTEGER
  - `burn_after_read`, `zero_knowledge`, `is_public` must be INTEGER (0 or 1)
  - `password`, `language`, `content`, `title`, `paste_id` should be TEXT or allow NULL if applicable

3. **Fix Recommendations (If Needed):**

- If `user_id` must be non-nullable but is not used, temporarily allow NULL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE pastes RENAME TO pastes_old;
-- Then re-create pastes with: user_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL
```

- If constraints are incorrect, drop and re-create the table from a fixed schema.

Conclusion:
-----------
This final schema check is critical to fully resolve the persistent SQL error. The values being inserted are correct, so the conflict is rooted in an incompatible or misconfigured schema definition.
